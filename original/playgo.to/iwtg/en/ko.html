<h2>Ko (eternity)</h2>
Now, I will describe the additional rule called <b>Ko</b> - which means eternity in Japanese. 
<p> This is the last rule to remember. If you read this page, then you will understand 
  all the rules of Go. 
<p> The concept of Ko is a little more difficult than the rules described so far.<br>
Good luck!

One white stone is in Atari. <b>Get it!</b>
      <p> You got it? Then watch the board carefully.
      <p> You will see a black stone that you have just put is in Atari!<br>
        It would seem that white could capture this... 
      <p> What will happen if white does it?<br>
        It will result in the same board position of two moves earlier.<br>
        Thus, both black and white keep capturing one stone forever! 
      <p> Therefore, <b>the moves which produce the same board position are prohibited</b>. 
        <br>
This concept is called <b>Ko(eternity)</b>.
      <p> In the board above, you can also make moves for white. Thus, try to 
        take the black stone in the middle.<br>
Then you will see the message - <b><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Illegal(Ko)</font></b>.<p>
</td></tr></table>
Can white ever capture the black stone? 
<p> He can. But he must play somewhere else first.<br>
  That way it will produce a different board position. Therefore, <b>you can take 
  the Ko stone back once you play somewhere else.</b> 
<p> Make a move wherever you like for white on the above board.<br>
  And make a move again for black in the same way. 
<p>Now, it is white's turn again. White now can take a black stone back again.<br>
  Just make sure on the board above.
<p> Then it's black's turn. However, she can't get white back immediately. <br>
  Please make sure on the board. You will see the message - <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><b>Illegal(Ko)</b>.</font><br>
  She can get the stone again once she makes a move on other places as white did.
<p>
On the board above, you can make moves for both black and white.<br>
  Please understand the concept of Ko prohibition rule by playing there.<br>
  You can undo your moves by pressing the <b>undo</b> button.

How does Ko appear in a real battle?
      <p> Look on the left. Five black stones on the upper side are about to die.<br>
        First, capture a white stone by playing at <b>E8</b>.<br>
        Now, Ko fight has begun!
      <p> The five white stones are now in danger and white can't take a black 
        stone by playing <b>D8</b> because it is prohibited by the Ko rule. 
      <p> Thus, he plays somewhere black can't ignore such as <b>E2</b>. <br>
        Because eight black stones will be killed if ignored, black reluctantly 
        plays at <b>E1.</b> 
      <p>
Now, white is able to get the Ko stone back by <b>D8</b><br>
        Then, black will play where white can't ignore such as <b>B4</b>. If white 
        responds to it by <b>A4</b>, black can get the Ko stones back again by 
        playing at <b>E8</b>
      <p> We call this a <b>Ko fight</b>.
      <p>
</td></tr></table>
This Ko fight ends when either side ignores the opponent's threat by killing 5 
stones at the top.<br>
For the losing player, the loss of 5 stones is really big.<br>
Instead, he can make 2 successive moves at the other place and can gain a lot 
there. 
<p> The important thing is: to win the Ko fight, find the threat - the place where 
  you can gain a lot by making 2 successive moves . If the opponent doesn't allow 
  it, the Ko fight continues. If he ignores your threat, you can make 2 successive 
  moves while your opponent wins the Ko. 
<p>
<hr>
Ko is difficult because Ko fight involves many strategic moves on the entire board.<br>
For beginners, <b>just remember that moves which produce the same position are 
prohibited</b>.

<p> That is, Ko rule does not allow this situation to happen.
<p> Ko is not just a restrictive rule but it also makes Go more exciting.
