<h2>How to get started?</h2>
<p>By now you may already understand how to capture stones.<br>
  However, in the beginning of a real game, you have to play on a board with nothing 
  on it. </p>
<p>First, please take a look at the vast 19x19 board and see how we divide it 
  into areas and how we refer to each one..</p>
<p><img src="images/sumi-e.gif" width="323" height="321"> </p>
<p>As shown above, the 4 areas near the coner of the board is called &quot;<b>corners</b>&quot; 
  and the area between the two corners are &quot;<b>sides</b>&quot; and the center 
  is &quot;<b>middle</b>&quot;.<br>
  There are no distinct borders between these areas and we are just using these 
  names for convenience.</p>
<p>From which area do you want to start to move?</p>

    <td> The object of Go is to claim as much territory as possible. In the beginning 
      you have to try to surround territories i.e. empty spaces. 
      <p> In the figure on the left, there are two black groups: one on the upper 
        left corner and the one on the right side.<br>
        Each encloses 9 spaces, or 9 <b>points</b>.
      <p> A white group in the middle also has 9 points. These spaces completely 
        surrounded by stones of the same color are called <b>territories</b>.
      <p> Now, the above three groups each have a territory of 9 points. Count 
        the number of stones needed to surround the territory. 
      <ul>
<li>Corner - 6 stones
<li>Side - 9 stones
<li>Middle - 12 stones
</ul>
Therefore, it is most efficient to surround territories in the corners, while 
      territories on the middle are least efficient. 
      <p> Thus, in the beginning of a game, each side will try to claim the corners 
        of a board. You hardly ever see plays in the middle.

<p>This is a real game played by two professional players.<br>
  Please observe how the game proceeds by pressing the <b>Next</b> button.<br>
  Only the first 20 moves will be shown.</p>

<p>You can see the first 4 moves are played around the 4 corners and then play 
  expands to the sides.<br>
  This game starts very calmly without any clashes between stones.</p>
<p>With the 20 moves played, what is the &quot;balance of power&quot; like?</p>
<p><img src="images/fuseki.gif" width="363" height="364"></p>
<p>The black shaded area represents where black is strong and white shaded area 
  is where white has bigger influence.<br>
  Therefore, all corners and sides loosely belong to either black or white.<br>
  However, it's still not definitely decided - there can be an &quot;invasion&quot; 
  at any time.</p>
<p>If you try to claim corners and sides just because they are easy to get, you 
  will probably make it harder to advance toward the middle.<br>
  And if you don't have your stones in the middle at all, it will be a big disadvantage 
  once a fight is started because the stones in the middle can have an influence 
  to every direction - which is really helpful.</p>
<p>These strategies in the opening game is called &quot;<b>Fuseki</b>&quot;.</p>
