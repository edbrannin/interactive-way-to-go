<h2>Kakari and Shimari - corners are profitable</h2>
<p>You will learn how to play in the beginning - especially, the negotiation around 
  the corners.</p>

    <td> You can see how real games are started on the 13x13 board on the left. 
      Click <b>Next</b> button repeatedly. You can step backwards with <b>Back</b> 
      button. 
      <p> First, each side played a position near two corners. 
      <p> The first move by black is called <b>3-3 point </b>( or<b> san-san</b>) 
        because it is located on the third line of vertical and horizontal lines 
        counting from the closest corner. This move guarantees a position that 
        can obtain the corner. 
      <p> On the next play, white also played on 3-3 point. 
      <p> The next move by black is called the <b>4-4 point</b> ( or <b>hoshi</b>) 
        where it is marked with a small black circle. This point can surround 
        a larger corner than a play on the 3-3 point. However, it can be invaded 
        more easily because it has more spaces between it and the edge of the 
        board. 
      <p> The fourth move by white is also a popular one. 
      <p> Of course, you can play anywhere on the board if it is not illegal.<br>
        Usually, a game proceeds from the corners to sides and eventually to the 
        middle. 
      <p> Though corners are the best places to get territory, no one would make 
        a move at as <b>M2</b> or <b>N1</b> because that would be too small.

    <td> Continuing from the above... 
      <p> On the fifth move, black reinforced his lower left corner by playing 
        on <b>F3</b>. These kind of strengthening moves are called <b>Shimari</b>( 
        or 'enclosure' moves) 
      <p> On the next move, white also strengthened her lower right corner with 
        a different kind of shimari. 
      <p> Next, black put a stone near a white stone.(<b>J10</b>) This move implies 
        that if white ignores it, black will invade the corner by playing somewhere 
        like <b>L11</b>. This kind of approach move is called <b>Kakari</b>(attacking, 
        or aiming). 
      <p> Then white &quot;touched&quot; the black stone by playing <b>J11</b> 
        to strike back. After that, each side strengthened themselves.(<b>K11</b>,<b>G10</b>) 
      <p> White thought that it was looking as if the left side of the board would 
        be black's territory. Thus she invaded in the left side by herself to 
        prevent that! These moves are called <b>Uchikomi</b> (smashing, striking, 
        or invading) - By the way, you don't have to remember these Japanese words 
        right now. 
      <p> This is one of example showing how games are started.

<p>Keep in mind that <b>Go is a sharing game</b> - you can't get everything. <br>
  You have to yield, you have to sacrifice, you have to apologize if you were 
  too greedy. <br>
  If you were too aggressive, you will lose everything, literally!</p>
