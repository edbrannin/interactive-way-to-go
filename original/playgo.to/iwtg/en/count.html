<h2>End game</h2>
Here you will learn how to tell when a game is finished and how to count territories 
using 5x5 boards. 
<hr>
<img src="images/end1.gif" width=158 height=158 align=left>
Both sides made 5 moves each and the game is considered to be finished.<p>
Black has 5 points on the left and white has 10 points on the right.
<p> Thus white wins by 5 points.
<p>
You can count the places as territories where a vertical and a horizontal line meet.<p>
Corners and edges are also included.<br>
  Remember that stones are not counted as territories. <br clear=left>
<hr>
<img src="images/end2.gif" width=158 height=158 align=left> A game is considered 
to be finished when both sides pass, because they don't want to make any more 
moves. 
<p> Why is the figure above considered to be finished?
<p>
Continuing from the above, assume that black makes a move inside the white's territory.<p>
It seems white can easily capture that invader. See the left figure.<p>
Thus black will not make such moves.<p>
<br clear=left>
<hr>
<img src="images/end3.gif" width=158 height=158 align=left> Now, what happens 
if you make a move inside your own territory? 
<p> With that move, you reduced your own territory by 1 point. Nobody wants to 
  do that!
<p>
Therefore, the uppermost figure is regarded to be the end of the game.<p>
(Although sometimes you have to play inside your territory in order to make two eyes or to strengthen your wall.)<p>
<br clear=left>
<hr>
<img src="images/end4.gif" width=158 height=158 align=left> This is also the end 
of the game. <br>
Black has 5 points and white has 6 points - white wins by 1 point. 
<p> What about the 2 points in the middle? They are called "<b>Dame</b>" - neutral 
  area - which belong to neither side.
<p> You can play here if you want although you will neither gain nor lose a point.
<p>
<br clear=left>
<hr>
<b>When does a game end?</b>
<p> - When both sides don't want to play anywhere and pass successively.<br>
  Then both territories are counted and the larger side wins. <br>
  Your final score is your territory on the board, plus the captures you have 
  removed from the board.
<p> - When either side thinks he can't win the game no matter how he plays, and 
  resigns.<br>
<p>Unlike many other games, this is considered an honorable outcome. Playing on 
  in the face of a crushing loss is not.
