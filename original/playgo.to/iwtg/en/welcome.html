<h2>The Interactive Way To Go</h2>
by Hiroki Mori (Email: mori&lt;at&gt;playgo.to) 
<p> Here, you can surely learn to play Go because you can <b>actually play</b>.
<p>
Enjoy!<p>
<h3>Before you begin, please remember just 3 rules below.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Two players (black and white) take turns, placing one stone on the board 
    at a time. 
    <p> 
  <li>A stone must be placed on the intersection of the vertical and horizontal 
    lines. 
    <p> 
  <li>Once a stone is placed, you can't move it, although under some conditions 
    it may be removed. 
    <p> 
</ul>
They are just too easy, aren't they? 
<p> Now, you understand half the rules of Go!
