<h2>The flow of a game</h2>
On the board below, you can observe a real game progressing from the first move 
to the end. 
<p> By clicking on the <b>Next</b> button, you can advance a move 
  with an explanation.
<p> Keep on clicking until it stops advancing.

<p> This is a sample game on a 9x9 board.
<p> At the end, black gained 28 points and white occupied 24 points.<br>
  However, as you can see the <b>dead</b> stones counts: one white stone was captured 
  thus white's territories are decreased by 1 point. 
<p>Thus, black won by 5 points.
<p> In this game, black controlled the left side and white occupies the right 
  from the beginning and the game finished peacefully.<br>
You could consider that <b>Go is a sharing game</b>.<p>
<hr>The next game is more exciting!<p>

Just don't mind if you can't understand what is happening.<p>
In the first game, both sides just tried to surround vacant spaces by sharing territories with each other.<p>
In this game, starting from the white's fourth move - the cut - , both tried to capture opponent's stones.<br>
Finally, black occupied on the upper right and the lower left, and white obtained the lower right and the upper left corners.<p>
White has 18 points and black has 14 points.<p>
In addition, black captured 2 white stones while white killed 7 black stones.<p>
Please notice that the 2 black stones on the upper left were dead as they are because they have nowhere to escape and will
eventually be dead.<br>
White doesn't have to bother to take the two stones by playing <b>C9</b>.<br>
However, when the game finishes white can take them out from the board and add to the dead stones.<p>
The result is:<p>
<ul>
Black: 14 - 7 = 7 points<br>
White: 18 - 2 = 16 points<p>
</ul>
Thus white won by 9 points.<p>
