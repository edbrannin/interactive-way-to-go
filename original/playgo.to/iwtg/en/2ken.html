<h2>More about jumps</h2>
<hr>
<img src="images/2ken.gif" width=259 height=257 align=left> This is called a <b>Two 
Point Jump </b>( or <b>Niken tobi</b>). 
<p> Although it will give you <b>wider influence</b> over the board, it is more 
  likely that the two stones will be cut by the enemy because they have a wider 
  gap.
<p> You also have <b>Three Point Jumps </b> and <b>Four Point Jumps</b>. <br>
  These large jumps are often used as the opening moves. <br clear=left>

<img src="images/keima.gif" width=259 height=257 align=left> This jump is called 
<b>Knight's move (Keima)</b> as in chess. 
<p> Knight's moves are often used to claim corner territories as shown in the 
  left. <br clear=left>

This is called <b>Kosumi</b> - a diagonal move.
<p> The two stones are virtually connected but it's a little <b>slow</b> because 
  the extension from the first stone is smaller than the other we have looked 
  at. <br clear=left>
