<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<b>The Interactive Way To Go</b> is now over.
<p> I hope that you can now appreciate that Go is really an interesting and an 
  exciting game.<br>
  Now, what do you have to do to keep playing Go and get stronger? 
<h3>1. Play Games</h3>
Go is a game. Have fun by playing as much as possible. You will learn a lot from just playing.
<p> If there is nobody to play with, then go to the Internet Go servers.
<p>
We have several Go servers in the net.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.online-go.com" target="_blank">online-go.com</a> - A modern web server with a large friendly community. The only server where you can play both live and correspondence games. 
  <li><a href="http://www.kiseido.com/" target="_blank">KGS</a> - Free and easy 
    place. 
  <li><a href="http://www.wing.gr.jp" target="_blank">WING</a> - Go servers in Japan. 
  <li><a href="http://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/" target="_blank">IGS(Internet 
    Go Server)</a> - The biggest Go server. Several hundred people are playing 
    at one time! 
</ul>
You can also play with computer programs. Several products are out there. Go playing 
programs are generally very weak but you can enjoy for a while. <a href="http://www.smart-games.com/igowin.html" target="_blank">Igowin</a> 
is one of the best software for beginners. It's free but only for Windows. 
<p>
<h3>2. Observe games</h3>
On the Go servers, you can watch other people playing Go.
You can learn a lot by observing strong players' games. <p>
Learning from professional players' games 
is the fastest way to get stronger. 
<p>
<h3>3. Solve problems</h3>
The <a href="http://playgo.to/problem/tsumego.html" target="_top">Life and Death 
problems</a> are problems on how to kill or survive a group of stones locally 
on the board. There are many valuable techniques there.

<p>I really appreciate Tel Monks, who helped me to check all the English pages 
  of this tutorial.<br>
  His site, <a href="http://www.telgo.com/">Tel's Go Notes</a>, is also good for 
  beginners who want to know more about strategy, concepts, and life and death 
  problems.
