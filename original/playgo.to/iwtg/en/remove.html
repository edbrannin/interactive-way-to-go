<h2>The goal of Go</h2>
The objective of Go is to make your "territory" larger than that of your opponent.<br>
At first, you may be confused about where to place your stones because you can 
play almost anywhere on the board. 
<p> One way to make territory is to "capture" opponent's stones. 
<p> Stones that are surrounded are removed from the board and are handed to the 
  opponent as prisoners. <br>
  Each prisoner will be worth one point. 
<p>
