<h2>Komi</h2>
In normal games, black always plays the first move.<br>
Thus, <b>black has a slight advantage</b> against white.
<p> To compensate this unfairness, white is sometimes given bonus points, called 
  <b>Komi</b>, when counting territories in the end. 
<p> This bonus is usually<b> 6.5 points</b>. That means the value of the first 
  move is considered to be about 6 and a half points. <br>
  The additional half point is introduced to prevent draw. 
<p>
For example, if black has 7 points more territories than white, black wins by 0.5 point.<br>
If black has 6 more points than white, white wins by 0.5 point.
<p> In the old days of Go, there was no Komi system. As more people become aware 
  of the black's advantage, Komi was introduced. 
<p>
The amount of Komi is changing over time. When it was introduced in Japanese Professional games, it was 4.5 points.<br>
However, black still had better chance to win, so Komi was increased to 5.5 points in 1974. In 2002, the Japanese Go Association again increased the Komi value to 6.5.
<p> With this Komi system, <b>Go has almost no drawn games</b> and has become 
  more exciting and fairer.

<h2>The Handicap Game</h2>
When the strength of the two players are different, the weaker side places some 
number of stones before the game begins for a handicap. 
<p> In handicap games, <b>the weaker side always plays black</b> and stronger 
  side plays white. 
<p> Black places handicap stones on the specified points and then white plays 
  the first move.
<p> The number of handicap stones reflects the difference of the two players. 
<p> If the weaker player is 5 Kyu and the stronger player is 2 Kyu, 3 handicap 
  would be used. 
<p> With the handicap stones, black has advantage over every aspect of the game 
  - attacking, defending, surrounding territories, etc.
<p> It is said that <b>one handicap stone is equivalent to 10 points</b> of territories.
<p> Thus, if you played an even game with me and lost by 50 points, a 5 handicap 
  game would be appropriate for us to give us both an even chance to win. 
<p> The position of handicap stones is conventionally specified as below.

In every case, handicap stones are placed on the <b>4-4 points (star points)</b> 
which are marked with small black circle. However, you can have more than 9 handicap 
stones by placing stones elsewhere. 
<p> With the handicap game, <b>everyone can enjoy playing Go with the same chance 
  to win even no matter how different the players' strength are</b>, without altering 
  the rule.
